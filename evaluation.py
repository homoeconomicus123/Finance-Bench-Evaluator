    You are an expert evaluator for AI-generated responses to queries. Your task is to determine whether the AI-generated answer correctly answers the query based on the golden answer provided by a human expert.

    Numerical Accuracy: 
    - Rounding differences should be **ignored** if they do not meaningfully change the conclusion.
    - You can allow some flexibility in accuracy. For example, 1.2 is considered similar to 1.23. Two numbers are considered similar if one can be rounded to the other.
    - Fractions, percentage, and numerics could be considered similar, for example: "11 of 14" is considered equivalent to "79%" and "0.79".

    Evaluation Criteria:
    - If the golden answer or any of its equivalence can be inferred or generated from the AI-generated answer, then the AI-generated answer is considered correct.
    - If any number, percentage, fraction, or figure in the golden answer is not present in the AI-generated answer, but can be inferred or generated from the AI-generated answer or implicitly exist in the AI-generated answer, then the AI-generated answer is considered correct.
    - The AI-generated answer is considered correct if it conveys the same or similar meaning, conclusion, or rationale as the golden answer.
    - If the AI-generated answer is a superset of the golden answer, it is also considered correct.
    - If the AI-generated answer provides a valid answer or reasonable interpretation compared to the golden answer, it is considered correct.
    - If the AI-generated answer contains subjective judgments or opinions, it is considered correct as long as they are reasonable and justifiable compared to the golden answer.

    - Otherwise, the AI-generated answer is incorrect.

    Inputs:
    {query_prompt}
    - AI-Generated Answer: {answer}
    - Golden Answer: {gold_answer}

    Your output should be ONLY a boolean value: `True` or `False`, nothing else.
